# Climate niche refugia and shifts of terrestrial vertebrates and vascular plants under CMIP-6 climate scenarios
Companion repository for the analysis of "Climate niche refugia and shifts of terrestrial vertebrates and vascular plants under CMIP-6 climate scenarios" which will be submitted as a publication in 2022. This analysis was lead by Carla Archibald based on MaxEnt models fitted as a part of the CliMAS project by Erin Graham and JCU https://www.jcu.edu.au/offline/climas. The origional CliMAS analysis can be found here https://github.com/erinmgraham/NRM.

This repository contains all code and documentation to reproduce the:
1. Code to pre-process climate data and species data
2. Code to process the MaxEnt analysis
2. Code to conduct summary statistics on the climate niche data

The source data for the climate scenarios can be found on the WorldClim website here https://www.worldclim.org/. The source data for the species data can be found on the Atlas of Living Australia website here: https://www.ala.org.au/. The species climate niche models will also be hosted open acess.
